# Text-Summarizer
## About

An Abstractive text summarizer trained using lstm based sequence to sequence model with attention mechanisim. The attention model is used for generating each word of the summary conditioned on the input sentence.

- Used CNN_DailyMail dataset.

## Conclusion
- ðŸ«¶  The machine learning model to convert a text document to abstract is done successfully.
- ðŸ«¶  On additive to it, will deploy the model using standard deployments..
- ðŸ«£  Will update the future deployments too here and remove these lines...
